## Synopsis

A simple contacts manager built with Angular, jQuery and Bootstrap.

## Motivation

I have been reading about Angular and decided to try out some of this information in a practical way so I have opted for a simple crud interface to manage contact information.

I'd like to update this to:

- Not use jQuery within the Angular controller.
- Include the use of indexed db for data storage.

## Screenshots

Viewing and searching contacts:

![List Contact](/screenshots/list.png "List Contact")

Adding a contact:

![Add Contact](/screenshots/add.png "Add Contact")

Removing a contact:

![Remove Contact](/screenshots/remove.png "Remove Contact")

Viewing added and removed contacts:

![View Added And Removed Contacts](/screenshots/added_removed.png "View Added And Removed Contacts")

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/craigvantonder/angular-jquery-contacts-manager.git
